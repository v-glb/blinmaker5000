## What the blin?!

'Blin' is the russian word for 'pancake' (and also the family friendly version
of a very bad russian swear word also starting with b) and that's what this
small program is about: You tell it how many eggs, milk and flour you got and
it will tell you in return how many blins you can cook. Brilliant!

## Why?

Because I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIZEfjYmtM) of
'Life of Boris' and got inspired to do a fun little version of the blinmaker
myself. So, special thx to Boris!

## How does it work?

Just enter your amount of ingredients in the forms, hit enter and finally hit
the Calculate!-Button. Like shown below:
